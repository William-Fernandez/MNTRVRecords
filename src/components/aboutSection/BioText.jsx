                MNTRV Records is an independent electronic music label founded
                in London in 2025 by Colombian producer Zarek. Focused on tech
                house, minimal and house, the label takes its name from the word
                mantra – symbolising repetition, focus and elevation. With
                international distribution, MNTRV delivers groove-driven music
                designed for the global club scene, digital listeners and
                collectors alike. <br /><br />
                Built on transparency and artistic integrity,
                MNTRV Records supports forward-thinking electronic music while
                offering fair models for artists. While the catalogue debuts
                with Zarek’s own productions, the label opens its doors to
                collaborations and emerging talent, with plans for selected
                vinyl editions to accompany standout releases.
